# Complex Numbers and Mobius Transformations

## Artworks

Artworks are generated by running the the example binaries.

```sh
cargo run --example EXAMPLE_NAME [ARGS]
```

| Example | Description |
|---| ---|
| `halloween2024` | Halloween-themed sketches |
|`balanced_brackets` | balanced brackets visualized on a circle. |
| `crinkle_arc` | A fractal pattern made from circular arcs |
| `grid` | A hyperbolic grid pattern |
| `mirror_tiling` | A wallpaper tiling made with mirrors |
| `nacho` | A fractal based on the sierpinski curve, but shaped like a chip |
| `permutation_arc` | Visualize permutations as circular arcs |
| `mobius_sierpinski` | ⚠️Seems to be broken? |
| `three_lenses` | A fractal made from 3 lens shapes |
| `tricorn` | A variation on `nacho` |

## Code

- `algorithms` - this includes different algorithms for making fractals with iterated function systems
- `geometry` - geometric objects that can be transformed with this math code
- `motifs` - Basic shapes used in the examples ()
