# Math Artworks

Artworks are generated by running the the example binaries.

```sh
cargo run --example EXAMPLE_NAME [ARGS]
```

| Example | Description |
|---| ---|
| `halloween2024` | Halloween-themed sketches |
| `balanced_brackets` | balanced brackets visualized on a circle. |
| `crinkle_arc` | A fractal pattern made from circular arcs |
| `grid` | A hyperbolic grid pattern |
| `mirror_tiling` | A wallpaper tiling made with mirrors |
| `nacho` | A fractal based on the sierpinski curve, but shaped like a chip |
| `permutation_arc` | Visualize permutations as circular arcs |
| `mobius_sierpinski` | ⚠️Seems to be broken? |
| `three_lenses` | A fractal made from 3 lens shapes |
| `tricorn` | A variation on `nacho` |

## Artworks List

⚠️ Sort these by creation order (check git history)

### Balanced Brackets (2024)

⚠️THUMBNAIL of balanced brackets

Usage:

```sh
cargo run --example balanced_brackets NORTH_BRACKETS SOUTH_BRACKETS [ARGS]
```

⚠️ Link to Hyperbolic Connections in `p5-sketchbook`
⚠️ Give some examples
⚠️ Point out connections to tree traversals

| Argument | Description |
| --- | ---|
| `NORTH_BRACKETS` | String of balanced brackets like `[][][]` |
| `SOUTH_BRACKETS` | String of balanced brackets of the same length as `NORTH_BRACKETS` |
| `-e/--equator` | Draw the equator for reference | 
| `-s/--suffix SUFFIX` | Add a suffix to the filename, i.e. `output/bracket_<line|circle>_<SUFFIX>.svg`|

## Halloween 2024

Usage

```
cargo run --example halloween2024 [ARTWORK]
```

This will generate all the halloween-themed patterns. You can also specify
one of the following artwork names to run just that one example

⚠️Add a thumbnail column here
⚠️Some of these deserve further explanation

| Artwork ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `candy-corners` | Hyperbolic tiling with candy corn at each corner |
| `hex-grid` | Hexagonal grid with witch hats. It's a pun. |
| `bone-tree` | Tree of skulls and bones |
| `rib-cage` | Skull and an unusual rib cage |
| `ghost-octahedral` | A ghost flies around an octahedral group formed from Mobius transformations |
| `ghost-double-spiral` | A ghost explores a double spiral transformation |
| `ghost-gasket` | A ghost explores Apollonian Gasket fractal mentioned in _Indra's Pearls_ |
| `warpedpaper` | Wallpaper warped into circles with a Mobius transformation |

## Crinkle Arc (2024)

⚠️THUMBNAIL

A fractal I made up by taking a circular arc and recursively computing
orthogonal arcs

Usage:

```sh
cargo run --example crinkle_arc
```

## Grid (2024)

⚠️THUMBNAIL

A grid made up of hyperbolic and elliptic Mobius transformations. Another
way of thinking about is taking the parallels and meridians of a globe
and projecting them onto a wall from the equator (using stereographic projection)

⚠️This could potentially be renamed "parallels and meridians"... OR add more grid types

Usage:

```sh
cargo run --example grid
```

### Mirror Tiling (2025)

⚠️THUMBNAIL

A simple wallpaper tiling of `p, q, b, d` shapes to test a new algorithm
that handles mirror transformations more efficiently

Usage:

```sh
cargo run --example mirror_tiling
```

### Mobius Sierpinski (2024)

⚠️ I feel like Mobius Sierpinski, Nacho and Tricorn should be combined
into one example program with options since they're variations on the same
pattern.

Usage:

```sh
cargo run --example mobius_sierpinski
```

### Nacho (2024)

⚠️ THUMBNAIL

Usage:

```sh
cargo run --example nacho
```

### Tricorn (2024)

⚠️ THUMBNAIL

Usage:

```sh
cargo run --example tricorn
```

### Permutation Arcs (2024)

⚠️THUMBNAIL for several inputs (label them)

Usage:

```sh
cargo run --example permutation_arcs PERMUTATION
```

Where PERMUTATION is a cycle notation for a permutation with at most 50
elements, e.g. `(1 2 3)(4 5)`

### Three Lenses (2024)

⚠️ THUMBNAIL

```sh
cargo run --example three_lenses
```
